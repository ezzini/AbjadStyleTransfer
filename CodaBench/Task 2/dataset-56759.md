<h1>Data Description</h1>
<p>The dataset for this task is <strong>MA’AKS</strong> (Mughaus et al., 2025), a manually-curated parallel dataset for Arabic text sentiment swap.</p>
<p>It consists of 5,000 sentence pairs in Modern Standard Arabic where each pair consists of two sentences that share the same core topic but have opposite sentiment polarities (one positive, one negative).</p>
<p>The data was curated from social media and news commentary and manually annotated and cross-validated to ensure high quality in terms of fluency, meaning preservation, and accurate sentiment inversion.</p>
<p>The data will be split into:
<ul>
    <li>Training: 4,000 pairs</li>
    <li>Development: 500 pairs</li>
    <li>Test: 500 pairs</li>
</ul>
