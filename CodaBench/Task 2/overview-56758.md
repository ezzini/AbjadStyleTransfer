<h1>AraSentEval 2026: Subtask 2 - Arabic Sentiment Swap</h1>
<p>This is a generative task where participants' systems must rewrite a given sentence to invert its sentiment polarity (e.g., positive to negative) while preserving its core meaning.</p>
<p>This challenges models to go beyond surface-level cues and demonstrate a deeper grasp of semantics and syntax.</p>
<h2>Task Description</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Input</strong>: An Arabic sentence and its source polarity (e.g., "هذا المطعم رائع للغاية", positive).</li>
    <li><strong>Output</strong>: A new Arabic sentence that preserves the core meaning of the input but expresses the opposite polarity (e.g., "هذا المطعم سيء للغاية").</li>
</ul>
