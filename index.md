# **AbjadStyleTransfer**: Shared Task on Authorship Style Transfer (Text Generation)

### Hosted with [AbjadNLP(2026)](https://wp.lancs.ac.uk/abjad/) at EACL 2026, Rabat, Morocco

## 1. Overview of the Shared Task
**AbjadStyleTransfer** focuses on **Authorship Style Transfer (Text Generation)** for languages that use the Arabic script, including **Modern Standard Arabic and Urdu**. The goal is to transform a formal input text into the style of a specified author while preserving semantics, with a strict focus on **literature**.

Unlike general text style analysis, Authorship Style Transfer (AST) aims to actively modify text to conform to a distinctive writing style. This shared task seeks to promote research in AST for Arabic-script languages, an area that remains relatively underdeveloped.

## 2. Motivation
Authorship style transfer has applications in education, cultural preservation, and content generation. The Arabic script is used by diverse languages with rich literary traditions. This task addresses challenges such as:
- **Linguistic diversity**: Covering MSA, Urdu, Persian, and Kurdish.
- **Complex Morphology**: Handling the rich morphology of these languages.
- **Style Preservation**: Capturing the nuances of literary styles.

## 3. Data
The dataset focuses on literature from prominent authors in the target languages.
- **Source**: Literary works (novels, essays, etc.).
- **Task**: Transform formal text into the style of these authors.

## 4. Task Description
### AbjadStyleTransfer
- **Goal**: Transform a formal input text into the style of a specified author while preserving semantics.
- **Scope**: Literature in Modern Standard Arabic, Urdu, Persian, and Kurdish.
- **Evaluation**: BLEU, chrF
